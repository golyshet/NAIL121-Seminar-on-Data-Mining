The **Global Terrorism Database** dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd) contains information on terrorist attacks that occurred in various parts of the world from 1970 to 2017. It is is a very useful dataset, as it allows a better understanding of the nature of terrorist acts and the use of the acquired knowledge to create measures to ensure security.
The data includes information on more than 200,000 terrorist incidents that occurred in more than 200 countries and territories. Each incident contains information about the location of the incident, the type of terrorist act, the purpose of the attack, the number of victims, organizational groups and much more.
Analysis of this dataset can help reveal trends in terrorist activity in different regions of the world, as well as help determine what factors may influence the number of terrorist attacks in different regions and at different times.
